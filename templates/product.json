I've always been interested in enhancing certain areas naturally, and mixing this potent ampoule with my eye cream has been transformative.<br/><br/>What stands out about Volufiline is its ability to stimulate lipid production in fat cells, promoting a fuller and more voluminous appearance. By incorporating it into my eye cream regimen, I've noticed a significant improvement in the firmness and plumpness around my eye area. Fine lines appear smoother, and my skin feels more hydrated and resilient.<br/><br/>The ampoule's concentration ensures that a little goes a long way, allowing me to customize my skincare routine effortlessly. I appreciate the versatility it offers, as I can mix it with different skincare products to target specific areas of concern effectively.</p>"

I also added 5 drops to a small jar of lip balm. I carefully apply the balm to my lips after microneedling. This definitely facilitates a rosy glow and mild lip plumping. I can't say that I've noticed any increase of fat. I think I may be one of the \"this doesn't work for me.\" As a mature woman, my lips have thinned out considerably, and I was hopeful this product would improve this issue. So far, I do not see or feel any long-term benefits. I haven't entirely given up. I will continue to use until the bottle is empty. If there are no visible results thereafter, I won't purchase again. I still gave 4 stars because there are benefits to the right skin types or possibly it has to do with age. Less mature skin may see better/faster results. BTW, I've been using the product for about 3 weeks.</p>"

I saw claims that this can reduce the appearance of that.<br/>First of all, the packaging is very cute. The instructions suggest that you mix the solution with an already existing moisturizer. It comes with a small container and spatula to mix the products together evenly.<br/>The volufiline feels like an oil. It’s very hydrating and makes my skin feel nice. However, I don’t know that it made a huge difference in the actual appearance of the fat beneath my eyes. If you’re buying this *only* for the filler effect, I don’t think it works as effectively as it says. If you’re just trying it out for hydrating/to experiment I would say go for it. I know the results vary on everyone but personally it hasn’t made much of a difference in my appearance. I don’t know that I would buy again, but I think it’s a good value for the money for at least a hydrating serum.</p>"

But today I used it by itself and I don’t feel that anymore. So I guess just be careful where you put it I wouldn’t put it in a lip product even though it says to do that.

I do also think that that’s just because the volufiline is moisturizing. Skin being more moisturized just makes it look fuller, I do think that mixing this with a cheaper moisturizer to make an eye cream, does perform similar to something that’s worth more than the two ingredients combined.

Though I’ve considered experimenting with morning applications, as individual experiences might vary. A word of caution – applying it directly without a serum or moisturizer made my skin sensitive, so following the instructions is a must, especially for those with sensitive skin like mine.<br/><br/>Experimenting is key, and while I’ve mainly focused on my face, I’ve heard it can be used on various parts of the body too. I’m happy with the results so far and plan to continue using it, awarding it a well-deserved 5 stars.

I know it recommends to mix it with a moisturizer or some other skin care but I just raw dog this b right on my skin. I will say to use a q tip and be precise with where you put it because, by the time you wake up in the morning, it’ll be in your eyes and it doesn’t feel that amazing. It doesn’t burn, it just feels uncomfortable. Oh and remember to try not to rub your eyes 😌 overall, I definitely recommend!</p>"

But it seems to have made me look younger due to the plumping. Have used for about 2 weeks now. It seems quite amazing. I cannot tell how or what has plumped up my skin. I describe it as using really good eye patches, yet even if you use those every day the effects only last an hour or so.</p>"
